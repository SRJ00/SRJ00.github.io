Hello! I am Saurav Jadhav, creator of the site and author of this blog post. I am a undergraduate student in statistics and I love simplifying Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. I always feel, gaining intuition of a subject is paramount, and feels great when things suddenly start making some sense. Knowing how mathematics makes life better gives me happiness, off course not to everyone.
